    # Nodes make up the strongDM network, and allow your users to connect securely to your resources. There are two types of nodes:
    # - **Gateways** are the entry points into network. They listen for connection from the strongDM client, and provide access to databases and servers.
    # - **Relays** are used to extend the strongDM network into segmented subnets. They provide access to databases and servers but do not listen for incoming connections.
