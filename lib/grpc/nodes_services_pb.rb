    # Nodes make up the StrongDM network, and allow your users to connect securely to your resources.
    # There are three types of nodes:
    # 1. **Relay:** creates connectivity to your datasources, while maintaining the egress-only nature of your firewall
    # 2. **Gateway:** a relay that also listens for connections from StrongDM clients
    # 3. **Proxy Cluster:** a cluster of workers that together mediate access from clients to resources
